# **License Plate Detection and Recognition System**

This project implements a **two-stage AI pipeline** to detect and recognize Iranian license plates using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for object detection and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for character recognition.

---

## **Overview**

This project includes:

- **License Plate Detection (LPD)**: Localizing plates in images using YOLOv12.
- **License Plate Recognition (LPR)**: Identifying alphanumeric characters using CNNs.

---

## **Technologies & Libraries**

- Python
- [Ultralytics YOLOv12](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- PyYAML

---

## **Dataset**

The dataset includes:
- Annotated vehicle images with license plates (for detection)
- Cropped license plates (for character recognition)

## **Tasks Breakdown**

### **1. License Plate Detection (LPD)**
- Trained YOLOv12 model on custom data.
- Used Ultralytics API for training & testing.
- Evaluated via confidence scores and visual outputs.

### **2. License Plate Recognition (LPR)**
- Designed CNN model to classify:
  - **7 digits + 1 Persian letter**.
- Trained on cropped plates from LPD output.
- Achieved high character-level accuracy.

### **3. Pipeline Integration**
- YOLO model detects plate region.
- CNN recognizes characters from cropped plate.
- End-to-end license plate number generated.

### **4. Evaluation**
- **Detection**: mAP (mean Average Precision)
- **Recognition**: Character-level accuracy
- Visualized full plate predictions
